# A Visual Introduction to Fisher Information

This repository contains the Python code used to generate the plots for the YouTube tutorial "A Visual Introduction to Fisher Information and the CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bound."

The script uses `matplotlib` in `xkcd` mode to create an intuitive, step-by-step visual explanation of core statistical concepts, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), the CramÃ©r-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), and the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM).
